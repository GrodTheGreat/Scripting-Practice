### Project 8: System Monitoring Script
**Overview:**
- Develop a script to monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage) and generate alerts if usage exceeds thresholds.

**Skills Focus:**
- Accessing system information
- Conditional alerts and notifications

**Other Considerations:**
- Logging monitoring data
- Sending notifications (email, system messages)

### Project 9: Task Automation
**Overview:**
- Write a script to automate a routine task, such as downloading and organizing files from the internet.

**Skills Focus:**
- Task scheduling
- Network operations

**Other Considerations:**
- Error handling and retries

### Project 10: Deploying a Simple Web Application
**Overview:**
- Create a script to automate the deployment of a simple web application (e.g., a static site or a simple server application).

**Skills Focus:**
- Automation of complex tasks
- Working with web servers (setting up and configuring)

**Other Considerations:**
- Using version control (Git)
- Integrating with cloud services (optional)

### Technologies/Frameworks to Consider
- **Python:** Libraries such as `os`, `shutil`, `requests`, `re` (regex), `subprocess`.
- **Bash:** Command-line utilities like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cron`.
- **PowerShell:** Cmdlets, `Get-Command`, `Invoke-WebRequest`, `ScheduledTasks`.
- **Windows Command Line:** Batch scripting commands, Task Scheduler.
